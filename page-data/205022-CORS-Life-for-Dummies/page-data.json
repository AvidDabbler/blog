You come across <a href=\"https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere\">cors-anywhere</a> and think, “This is it!!! But how do do I deploy? Why aren’t the steps just out there?”</p>\n<p>Well now thanks to a fed up novice web developer. You too can solve these errors in a snap with your own private cors-anywhere deployment.</p>\n<h2>Install Dependencies</h2>\n<p>So if you do not have the following I would recommend installing them before you get started.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/downloads\">git</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm\">Node and npm</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next thing that you are going to need to do is install heroku via npm. Run:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">npm install heroku</code>.</p>\n<h2>Deploy Cors-Anywhere</h2>\n<p>Go ahead and either fork and clone or just clone the <a href=\"https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere\">cors-anywhere</a>. Once you have have the repo cloned on your machine you can deploy to Heroku in 2 steps. First open up your cli and go to the cloned directory then run:</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">git push heroku master</code></p>\n<p>If this is your first time working with Heroku you are going to need to sign up for a free account and then sign-in.</p>\n<p>If deployed correctly you should be able to go to the <a href=\"https://heroku.com\">Heroku</a> dashboard and find your cors-anywhere application</p>\n<h2>Configuring Cors-Anywhere</h2>\n<p>Once you have deployed and have it up and running you should be able to get to the options by going to the application > settings and then scroll down to <code class=\"language-text\">config vars</code> and click <code class=\"language-text\">reveal config vars</code>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"content%5Cblog%5C205022-CORS-Life-for-Dummies%5Cconfigure-vars.png\" alt=\"reveal config vars\"></p>\n<p>Right now there are 2 different variables that I have set up for my project:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere#demo-server\">RATELIMIT</a> - This sets up the amount of default requests can be made it take 3 different variables. Number of requests, reset of ratelimit, and a space separated list of exempt sites.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere#demo-server\">WHITELIST</a> - This is the master list of URL’s that you are allowed to use this application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"config%20content%5Cblog%5C205022-CORS-Life-for-Dummies%5Cwhitelist-ratelimit.png\" alt=\"whitelist and ratelimit\"></p>\n<h2>LINKS!!!</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>cors-anywhere -> <a href=\"https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere\">https://github.com/Rob—W/cors-anywhere</a></li>\n<li>heroku -> <a href=\"https://heroku.com\">https://heroku.com</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"CORS Life for Dummies","date":"May 26, 2020","description":"A dummies guide to deploying CORS-Anywhere to "}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/205022-CORS-Life-for-Dummies/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/200511-Stop-Using-American-FactFinder/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Stop Using American FactFinder"}},"next":null}}}
