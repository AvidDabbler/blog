In Asian\nsupermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted\ncharcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,\nwrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the\nsalted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a\nfirm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Just Another Blog Post","date":"August 16, 2014","description":"Analyzing"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/another-post/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}}}}}
