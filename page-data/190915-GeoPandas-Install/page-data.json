I have worked with Pandas in the past and had come across a couple of docs talking about GeoPandas.</p>\n<p>So as with all Python libraries I ended up having a tough time trying to install and setup my environment. I tried working with PIP and Conda, but the issues persisted. </p>\n<p>I ended up finding some documentation that speaks to this issue and the solution ended up being that I needed to install the decencies in the right order. However, those dependencies too were having issues installing. So what I ended up having to do is download the wheels manually and install them that way. </p>\n<h2>Issue Setting Up my Python Environment</h2>\n<p>When starting this project I thought that it would be pretty straight forward. I would just have to use a package manager to install all the dependencies and GeoPandas. I was wrong… it was frustrating. If you are in the same boat, don’t feel bad don’t be discouraged. We have all been there and part of earning your stripes is slogging through the endless documentation that beautiful individuals (like myself) have put together for you. </p>\n<p>When you are setting up the environment you need to make sure that you are installing all of the dependencies in the order in which they were meant to be installed. Each library builds on top of one another. The dependencies are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal\">gdal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona\">fiona</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj\">pyproj</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rtree\">rtree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely\">shapely</a></li>\n<li>geopandas</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The links in the list above should take you to where you need to go to download the python wheel files for each. Once you have downloaded them. Move them to a folder where you can access them easily. Then navigate via the command line to the folder to start the installs. </p>\n<p><strong>The above list is the order in which you need to install all of the dependencies. If any of these libraries are installed, go ahead and uninstall them now.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have all of the files downloaded use <code class=\"language-text\">pip</code> to install install them by using <code class=\"language-text\">pip install %file_location%</code>. </p>\n<p><strong>PROTIP:</strong> If you are on windows you can type <code class=\"language-text\">pip install</code> and then drag the file from File Explorer over to Command Prompt and it will copy over the full file location over. </p>\n<h3>Next with GeoPandas</h3>\n<p>Whenever I get around to it.
