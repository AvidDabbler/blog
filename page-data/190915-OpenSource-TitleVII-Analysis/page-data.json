I would just have to use a package manager to install all the dependencies and geopandas. I was wrong… it was frustrating. If you are in the same boat, don’t feel bad don’t be discouraged. We have all been there and part of earning your stripes is slogging through the endless documentation that beautiful individuals (like myself) have put together for you. </p>\n<p>When you are setting up the environment you need to make sure that you are installing all of the dependencies in the order in which they were meant to be installed. Each library builds on top of one another. The dependencies are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#gdal\">gdal</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fiona\">fiona</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj\">pyproj</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#rtree\">rtree</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#shapely\">shapely</a></li>\n<li>geopandas</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The links in the list above should take you to where you need to go to download the python wheel files for each. Once you have downloaded them. Move them to a folder where you can access them easily. Then navigate via the command line to the folder to start the installs. </p>\n<p><strong>The above list is the order in which you need to install all of the dependencies. If any of these libraries are installed, go ahead and uninstall them now.</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have all of the files downloaded use <code class=\"language-text\">pip</code> to install install them by using <code class=\"language-text\">pip install %file_location%</code>. </p>\n<p><strong>PROTIP:</strong> If you are on windows you can type <code class=\"language-text\">pip install</code> and then drag the file from File Explorer over to Command Prompt and it will copy over the full file location over. </p>\n<h2>Moving Toward Open Source GIS</h2>\n<h3>LINKS!!!!</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://geopandas.org/io.html\">http://geopandas.org/io.html</a> —> intro to geopandas\n<a href=\"https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/filegdb.html\">https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/filegdb.html</a> —> gdal documentation\n<a href=\"https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona#windows\">https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona#windows</a> —> setup fiona in windows\n<a href=\"https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/\">https://geoffboeing.com/2014/09/using-geopandas-windows/</a> —> Manual setup (What I had to use)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Setting up GeoPanadas on Windows","date":"September 07, 2019","description":"My attempt at breaking away from ArcGIS and Moving toward OpenSource Analysis"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/190915-OpenSource-TitleVII-Analysis/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/190915-UGH-I-Broke-My-Pi/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Ugh!!!
